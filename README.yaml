# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```
  # Example stacks/dev.yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      foo:
        settings:
          secrets-arn: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:MySecret-PlMes3
        vars:
          foo: bar
  ```

  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Get Atmos Setting for Secret ARN
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@main
            id: example
            with:
              component: foo
              stack: core-ue1-dev
              settings-path: settings.secrets-arn

          - name: Set ENV Vars with AWS Secrets Manager Secret
            uses: aws-actions/aws-secretsmanager-get-secrets@v2
            with:
              secret-ids: ${{ steps.example.outputs.value }}
  ```
  
  ## Migrating from `v1` to `v2`
  
  Starting from `v2` the action is no longer restricted to retrieving the component config from only the `settings` section.
  If you want the same behavior in `v2`  as in`v1`, you should add the `settings.` prefix to the value of the `settings-path` variable.
  For example, in `v2` you would provide `settings.secrets-arn` as the value to the `settings-path`
  ```yaml
    - name: Get Atmos Setting for Secret ARN
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@v2
      id: example
      with:
        component: foo
        stack: core-ue1-dev
        settings-path: settings.secrets-arn  
  ```
  
  Which would provide the same output as passing only `secrets-arn` in `v1`
  
  ```yaml
    - name: Get Atmos Setting for Secret ARN
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@v1
      id: example
      with:
        component: foo
        stack: core-ue1-dev
        settings-path: secrets-arn  
  ```
