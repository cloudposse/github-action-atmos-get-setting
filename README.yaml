# Short description of this project
description: GitHub Action to retrieve a setting from [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) configuration.

introduction: |-
  GitHub Action to retrieve settings from [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) configuration. There are two ways
  to use this action. The first is to retrieve a single setting and to get its value returned via the `value` output.
  The second is to retrieve multiple settings as an object returned via the `settings` output.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```
  # Example stacks/dev.yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      foo:
        settings:
          roleArn: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/MyRole
          secretsArn: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:MySecret-PlMes3
        vars:
          foo: bar
  ```

  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:

          # The following example will return a single setting value of
          # `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:MySecret-PlMes3` in the `value` output:
          - name: Get Atmos Single Setting for Secret ARN
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@main
            id: example
            with:
              component: foo
              stack: core-ue1-dev
              settings-path: settings.secrets-arn

          # The following example will return an object with the following structure in the `settings` output:
          # {"secretsArn":"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:000000000000:secret:MySecret-PlMes3", "roleArn":"arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/MyRole"}
          - name: Get Atmos Multiple Settings
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@main
            id: example
            with:
              settings: |
                - component: foo
                  stack: core-ue1-dev
                  settingsPath: settings.secrets-arn
                  outputPath: secretsArn
                - component: foo
                  stack: core-ue1-dev
                  settingsPath: settings.secrets-arn
                  outputPath: roleArn

  ```

  ## Migrating from `v0` to `v1`

  Starting from `v1` the action is no longer restricted to retrieving the component config from only the `settings` section.
  If you want the same behavior in `v1`  as in`v0`, you should add the `settings.` prefix to the value of the `settings-path` variable.
  For example, in `v1` you would provide `settings.secrets-arn` as the value to the `settings-path`
  ```yaml
    - name: Get Atmos Setting for Secret ARN
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@v1
      id: example
      with:
        component: foo
        stack: core-ue1-dev
        settings-path: settings.secrets-arn
  ```

  Which would provide the same output as passing only `secrets-arn` in `v0`

  ```yaml
    - name: Get Atmos Setting for Secret ARN
      uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-get-setting@v0
      id: example
      with:
        component: foo
        stack: core-ue1-dev
        settings-path: secrets-arn
  ```
